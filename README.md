# Spunvice
Spunvice (Spunky Service in short) is a mini store where we can download and try different application and games. Currently it is under heavy development and require java runtime environment to run. 

The program will be very soon adding tons of features so be sure to check out new releases.

The .java file given in the repository would work for MacOS and not for Windows due to difference in the way of finding file path.
